# Enhanced-Detection-of-Tiny-Objects-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
Imperial College London MEng EIE Final Year Project

The objective of this project is to be able to enhance the detection of tiny objects in the [DOTA((Dataset for Object detection in Aerial images)](https://captain-whu.github.io/DOTA/dataset.html) using [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) which is the latest version of the YOLO(You Only Look Once) model.
